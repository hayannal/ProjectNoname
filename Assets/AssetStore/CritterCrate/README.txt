Thank you for buying this crate of crazy critters!

for now there are four lovely critters to contend with, the crate itself and a few extra goodies,
and we will ship you four more critters before the year is out!

Each critter can be used directly from the Prefab folder and drag'n'dropped into your scene.

=====Technical notes====

Release version: 1.0

Each critter is set up with mechanim to blend between
idle and move with the float parameter 'moveSpeed' between 0f-1f.

With the single exception of Swinecone which has two move animations.
shuffle at 0.5f
and jump at 1f.

Idle is still setup to be played at moveSpeed 0f.
Swinecone also has a variant of the idle animation, which can be
blended into with the parameter 'idleVar' between 0f-1f.

The rest of the animations (along with the animations on the crate)
should be played with the Animator.Play() function.
