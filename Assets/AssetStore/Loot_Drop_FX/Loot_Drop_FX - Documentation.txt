Load "Loot_Drop_FX.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the loot drop effect effect of the required colour from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Click the left trigger the loot drop and the right mouse button to end the loot drop.

For maximum effect, consider adding some post processing to your scene with Unity's Post Processing Stack (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-839120). A post processing profile with Bloom is included in the Post_Processing folder.

Have fun!
