Required Standard Assets
_________________________________________________
  Meryl is using the ToonBasic shader from the Standard Assets.
  
  For the demo scene, it also use a few assets from the Prototyping standard assets (NavyGrid.mat, FloorPrototype64x01x64, GridEmissive.png and SwatchNavyAlbedo.png).
  
  You can also the the list of these in the "Required Standard Assets.jpg" jpg image.
  
  If you see missing shader or missing ground, do import those assets from the Standard Assets first.
